# Wallet Analyzr Back End

Hello! This is the backend for my submission for the Securitize challenge.

This backend is deployed at: https://wallet-analyzr-back-21dac7d5d0ba.herokuapp.com
Obviously, you are not supposed to interact with the back-end directly, but you can easily test it out by going to the above link.

I had only 3 days to develop this, so there are many things I would have loved to add or improve. Specially since this is the first time I do a NestJS project! I usually use Express directly or NextJS. However, I am very familiar with Java and Springboot which has a very similar structure to NestJS, so that helped a lot. Some of the things I would have loved to improve with more time are:

- Add more tests
- Add more error handling
- Add documentation
- Add more logging
- Conteinerize the app on a docker, with frontend and a Postgres DB included
- Add a CI/CD pipeline

If you have any feedback please feel free to reach out! I'm always looking to improve.
